# Number Average Calculator

## Program Overview

### What was the program:

This is a program that prompts the user to enter a series of numbers. The program stores the entered numbers in an array, calculates their sum, and computes the average once a non-numeric input is received. The program then displays the average of the entered numbers.

### Primary Idea and objective:

The objective of this program is to allow a user to enter a series of numbers, calculate their sum, and compute the average of those numbers. It is aimed at learning arrays with JavaScript and Node.js.

### Program Architecture

- Prompts the user to enter a number.
- Validates if the entered input is a number.
- Continues to prompt the user until a non-numeric value is entered.
- Calculates the sum and average of the entered numbers.
- Displays the average and exits the program when a non-numeric input is provided.
