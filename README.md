# Learn JavaScript by Practicing Small Projects

This project is a collection of small JavaScript exercises aimed at helping learners improve their coding skills by building simple, interactive programs. The focus is on understanding core programming concepts through hands-on practice.

---

## **Project Summary**

These exercises cover fundamental programming concepts, including:

- **Input/Output**: Capturing and validating user input.
- **Randomization**: Generating random numbers to create dynamic scenarios.
- **Conditional Logic**: Making decisions based on user input or other conditions.
- **Loops**: Iterating over data to perform repetitive tasks.
- **Array Manipulation**: Storing and processing collections of data.

Each project encourages learning by solving real-world-like problems and provides opportunities to debug and refine code.

## **How to Use These Exercises**

1. **Understand the Problem**: Read the exercise description and identify what the program should do.
2. **Write and Run Code**: Implement the solution in a `.js` file and execute it using Node.js.
   ```bash
   node filename.js
   ```
3. **Experiment and Modify**: Tweak the code to explore alternative solutions and better understand the logic.
